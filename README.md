# Custom LaTeX Style For Obsidian 

A streamlined process for defining custom LaTex commands and environments. 

NOTE: Importing packages is not currently supported :(

## Installation

Enable community plugins inside the Obsidian settings menu, search for "Custom LaTeX Style", and install them. 

Alternatively, download this repository into a folder and place it into every Vault you want to use the plugin. 

## Usage

In order to use this plugin, you must NOT have a file called `style.md` in the root of your Vault. 

Once you have enabled the plugin, press the "Load Declrations and Style File" button on the left ribbon. A file called `style.md` will be made in the root of your Vault. Define commands using `\newcommand` and environments `\newenvironment`.

Once you have done that, click the ribbon icon again to load your style. Now you can use whatever you have defined across your entire Vault!
